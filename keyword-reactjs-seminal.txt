Component
	- Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
	- Function and Class Components
	- Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.
		React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, <div /> represents an HTML div tag, but <Welcome /> represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope.
	- State v√† props
	  + props: Props have been used to send data to the other components. Every component is treated as a pure javascript function. Props are equivalent to parameters of a pure function so props are Read-Only (immutable)
	- JSX
